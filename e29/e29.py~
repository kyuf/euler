"""
Consider all integer combinations of a^b for 2 <= a <= 5 and 2 <= b <= 5:

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 <= a <= 100 and 2 <= b <= 100?
